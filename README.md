# Kitten Space Agency – Sol Scale Kerbol System

This is my very first mod for **Kitten Space Agency**.  
It replaces the default Solar System with the **Kerbol System** from Kerbal Space Program – but scaled to our (Sol) scale.  

Everyone is free to use, modify, or build upon this project however they please.

## Updates

- Fixed height maps
- Gave Laythe a nicer atmosphere
- Kerbin now looks weird from orbit but I kind of like it

## Notes

- This is my first attempt at modding KSA, so there’s probably a much better way to implement this.
- Still need to create a mesh to make smaller bodies look good. Moons like Minmus, ~~Dres~~, and Ike look pretty awkward at the moment.
- I can’t be bothered to polish it more right now, but I’m **very open to feedback, suggestions, or pull requests**.  
- Use this mod however you like — no restrictions.  
- This is more of a proof of concept than anything. Many bodies don't look nice, there are no terrain features yet and don't even try landing.
