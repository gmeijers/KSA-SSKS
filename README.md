# Kitten Space Agency – Sol Scale Kerbol System

This is my very first mod for **Kitten Space Agency**.  
It replaces the default Solar System with the **Kerbol System** from Kerbal Space Program – but scaled to **our (Sol) scale**.  

Everyone is free to use, modify, or build upon this project however they please.

## Installation

⚠️ **Important:** Make a backup first!

1. Navigate to your Kitten Space Agency installation directory.
2. Back up the following files (in case you want to restore later):
   - `Content/Core/Astronomicals.xml`
   - `Content/Core/SolSystem.xml`
3. Copy all files from this mod into the **main directory** of Kitten Space Agency.
4. Launch the game and enjoy exploring the Kerbol System at Sol scale!

## Notes

- This is my first attempt at modding KSA, so there’s probably a much better way to implement this.
- KSA doesn't seem to play nice with smaller celestial bodies. Moons like Minmus, ~~Dres~~, and Ike look pretty awkward at the moment.
- I can’t be bothered to polish it more right now, but I’m **very open to feedback, suggestions, or pull requests**.  
- Use this mod however you like — no restrictions.
