# Kitten Space Agency ‚Äì Sol Scale Kerbol System

This is my very first mod for **Kitten Space Agency**.  
It replaces the default Solar System with the **Kerbol System** from Kerbal Space Program ‚Äì but scaled to **our (Sol) scale**.  

Everyone is free to use, modify, or build upon this project however they please. üöÄ
